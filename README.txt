Last updated using projects released before Christmas. 12/25/25.

About:
  This is an archive of (most) projects once shared on CodeTorch. This archive was last updated: 12/30/25 at 10:006 PM EST.
All projects were collected using the public CodeTorch API. All data collected was public information obtained by myself. I am @speedychuck on CodeTorch
You may request data deletion of your own data.
This is supposed to be more of a hobby project, I will not take this too seriously.

Important Info:
  Each txt file is in JSON format. It includes a batch of projects. I started out having each batch be 100 files each but that has since changed. Thus, the number of projects in each batch isn't reliable.
Not every project is going to be here obviously, though that is the goal. However,some projects that I have archived are not listed here (yet) because the file size for a batch of projects was bigger than 25MB (Github's max file size per individual file).

How To Use:
Up to you...but if you want to actually search for stuff in this archive, use the CodeTorch project I made! https://codetorch.net/en/projects/23062
